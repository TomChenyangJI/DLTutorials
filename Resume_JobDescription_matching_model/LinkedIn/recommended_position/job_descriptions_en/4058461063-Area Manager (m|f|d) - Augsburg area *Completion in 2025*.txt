About The Team

It all started for Amazon with the fulfillment of our customer orders (Customer Fulfillment or CF). The Customer Fulfillment team has now transformed from a humble team of booksellers to a highly experienced global team that processes more than 1.5 million orders every day. The team forms the foundation of our business and has helped us expand into new geographies and services. Using emerging technology, we are constantly looking for ways to offer a bigger and better selection of products - delivered quickly and affordably.

CF team members are the first to ensure our customers receive their orders with the speed we are known for. We work in fulfillment centers that are at the heart of Amazon's dynamic operating network. Our fulfillment centers are sometimes referred to as the “first mile” – this is where most Amazon packages start their shipping route. We support the management of a dynamic inventory and enable fast deliveries around the clock.

Our fulfillment centers employ a diverse group of employees. There are numerous opportunities for people with a wide range of abilities. Some of us work with physical products. Others analyze data and help make smart decisions across the organization.
