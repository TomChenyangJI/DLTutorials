About Us

Ever thought about cloning yourself? Great news, we are building a human cloning company for you! At Beyond Presence, we’re on a mission to redefine digital interaction with our hyper-realistic avatars. Imagine having lifelike digital twins that can hold natural, human-like conversations—how cool is that?

Our journey began with our founders, who previously created Presize, a groundbreaking company that developed highly accurate digital body twins from a smartphone camera for an AI personal stylist. Their innovative work caught the attention of Meta, leading to a successful acquisition. Now, they’re bringing their expertise and passion to Beyond Presence, pushing boundaries and making the impossible possible.
