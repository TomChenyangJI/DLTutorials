What We Are NotThis is not a typical job.There is no salary or monetary compensation in the initial phase. We are looking for someone committed to the entrepreneurial journey, 🚀 willing to dedicate time and energy to solving a meaningful problem, and ready to weather challenges together.This role requires a long-term commitment—several years of dedication—to make a difference while having fun and embracing the ups and downs of startup life.

Initially, the role will be part-time (10–20 hours per week, depending on your availability). It will become full-time in a few months, once we secure funding to support all co-founders' salaries. You’re not joining a team with a finished product. This is the early stage, and we need a driver, not a passenger—your ideas will shape the product and the company.
If this sounds like you, let’s connect and discuss how we can build something incredible together!
