Company Overview:

Amazon is one of the fastest-growing companies with 10,000+ employees and revenue $10+ billion per year. It offers a competitive salary, various cool employee benefits, and a lot of opportunities for growth. However, things can be very siloed and bureaucratic in such big companies. Get ready for too many information, too many emails, and little guidance. However, if youâ€™re willing to go the extra mile, accept the challenges and prove yourself, you will be very successful here. Some Amazon employees praise a four-day work week, whereas some claim that kitchen could have better snack options. It all depends on your priorities.
