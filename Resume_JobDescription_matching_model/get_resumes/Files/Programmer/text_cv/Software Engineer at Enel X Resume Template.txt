Profile
Change being the only constant in this world, I learned how to adapt to changes, find opportunities in it and drive teams to embrace the change and make the most out of it. With 15+ years of experience spent as an individual contributor in small and large development teams, in tech and team leadership roles, and now as a Senior Software Engineer, I've become experienced with taking initiative/ownership of tasks and projects, communicating with stakeholders, estimating efforts and planning, proposing software architectures, technologies, and development platforms and tools.
