Position Overview:
Acquisition AnalystAcquisition analysts are corporate strategists who study their employer’s respective industry and make purchases and sales, enact reforms, and even oversee mergers with the goal of achieving sustained growth and greater efficiency. The main task through which these core responsibilities are conducted is the evaluation of financial reports, analyzing company operations, and thinking about how the company fits within a larger portfolio or business. Analysts build ‘mosaics’ to help the upper-level management make decisions on a deal with another company or important client. Numerical skills, as well as organizational and communication abilities, are fundamentally important for creating and implementing all recommendations.
