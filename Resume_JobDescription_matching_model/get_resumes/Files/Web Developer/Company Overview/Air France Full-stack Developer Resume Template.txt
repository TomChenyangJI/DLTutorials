Company Overview:

Air France is the French national airline company, part of Air France-KLM Holding Group, one of the biggest airline groups in the world. Considering recent developments in the airline industry, with cheaper tickets and low-cost airliners driving the competition, it is remarkable for an airline such as Air France to stay as relevant as it is. It has been able to do this due to its vast destination network and alliances with other global airlines. Additionally, it is able to provide frequent customers with a much higher standard of travel than some of the emerging industry leaders. Being an employee at Air France reflects this attitude and success. Employees are held to a high standard, but in return get many benefits, including flight rewards, paid leave, and good salaries.
