Company Overview:

I think we can all agree that IBM is not anymore the white knight of the IT industry as it was, for example, 40 years ago. But that doesn't mean it's not a great place to work and grow professionally and personally. It still operates in more than 170 countries, employs over 10,000 people, and has a revenue of $5+ billion per year. If you decide to join their team, you'll get a chance to work on the innovation of breakthrough technologies and will collaborate with colleagues from all over the world. IBM is also often ranked as one of the top global employers and has won multiple employer awards along the way. According to the employee reviews, the whole application and interview process is very long and can take up to 3 months which should, on the other way, definitely not discourage you to apply if you have dreamed about getting a job there.
