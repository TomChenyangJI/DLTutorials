Company Overview:

Refriango is a company located in Angola, specializing in producing and distributing soft drinks, juices, waters, and alcoholic beverages. It is currently positioned at the top of Angolan companies and also as one of the biggest references in Africa.  Controlling a vast distribution and production network, a majority of the company’s workforce spends its time in a manufacturing-esque environment. This can be off-putting to some people seeking jobs but working at a lower position at eh beginning does not mean there are no opportunities to climb the ladder. The food and drinks industry, after all, is one where growth and stability are expected always – people do not suddenly stop being hungry!
